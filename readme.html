 <li>If you want to change the Root directory of the folders and files which can be selected for backup, change the value of the "<span class="sb">ROOT_DIR</span>" constant with the path of the directory you want for Root (RELATIVE TO THE ROOT OF YOUR WEBSITE ON SERVER, starting with "/").</li>

 <li>Set CHMOD 0755 (or 0777) permissions to the "<span class="sb">spbm/backup/</span>" folder on your server (it is used to store the ZIP files with the backups).</li>

 <li>To Restore, Download or Delete archive with backup, click on the "<span class="sbi">Show saved ZIP files</span>" tab.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Settings for Cron</h3>
If you want to automatically backup MySQL database and directories, access the "<span class="sb">pbm_cron.php</span>" file with Cron Jobs (from hosting CPanel), passing the "<span class="sbi">cron=ADMIN_NAME</span>" for $_GET variable (ADMIN_NAME is the name added to the <span class="sbi">$admin_name</span> variable).<br>
For example, you can use one of these commands in Cron Jobs:
<pre>
curl http://WEBSITE_NAME/spbm/pbm_cron.php?cron=ADMIN_NAME > /dev/null

OR:
lynx -source http://WEBSITE_NAME/spbm/pbm_cron.php?cron=ADMIN_NAME > /dev/null

OR:
/usr/local/bin/php /home/CPanelUSER/public_html/spmb/pbm_cron.php ADMIN_NAME > /dev/null
</pre>
&bull; Edit these settings in "<span class="sb">config.php</span>":<br>
- In the <span class="sb">$bk_cron_mysql</span> array add your data for connecting to database.<br>
- In the <span class="sb">$bk_cron_dirs</span> array you can add the folders you want to backup, located in the ROOT_DIR (To backup all the folders and files of ROOT_DIR, let the value as it is: <span class="sb">['']</span>).<br>
Example:
<blockquote class="sb">$bk_cron_dirs = ['dir1', 'dir2', 'dir3'];</blockquote>
- In the <span class="sb">$bk_exc</span> array you can add the extensions of the files you want to exclude from backup.<br>
Example:
<blockquote class="sb">$bk_exc = ['ext1', 'ext2', 'ext3'];</blockquote>
- If you Not want to backup mysql database, set 0 to the <span class="sb">BK_CRON_SQL</span> constant.<br>
- If you Not want to backup directories, set 0 to the <span class="sb">BK_CRON_DIR</span> constant.

<h3>Other Specifications</h3>
&bull; By default, the ZIP archive with the database backup is saved with this format: "<span class="sbi">mysql-DB_NAME-DATE@TIME.sql.zip</span>", so, every backup of the same database is saved into a new Zip file. If you want to have a fixed name for the database backup, change the "<span class="sbi">new</span>" value of the <span class="sb">ZIP_SQL</span> constant with "<span class="sb">fix</span>"; so, the ZIP file with the database backup will have this format: "<span class="sbi">mysql-DB_NAME.sql.zip</span>" (In Cron the script uses "fix").<br><br>
&bull; The name of the ZIP archive with directories and files is saved with this format: "<span class="sbi">dir-ROOT_DIR.zip</span>".<br><br>
&bull; If you want to save the ZIP files in other directory on your server, modify the value of the <span class="sb">BK_DIR</span> constant in the "config.php" file.<br><br>
&bull; If you want to use the script in other language, translate the texts from the <span class="sb">lang_en.json</span> file (in the "<span class="sbi">spbm/templ/</span>" foder) and save it in other "lang_...json" file, with the indice of the language, for example for Chinese save the texts in the "lang_ch.json". The texts in the ".json" file must be stored in valid JSON format. Then, change the value of the <span class="sb">LANG</span> constant in the "config.php" file with the same indice.
<blockquote class="sbi">define('LANG', 'ch');</blockquote><br><hr><br>
